      Hi, my name's Alessandro Pucci and i'm a Unity3D developer.

      I grew up with a SNES controller in my hands playing Donkey Kong and getting fascinated about videogames.

      After some years attending computer science courses at Siena University, i coosed to pursue my passion for games and start searching something that could fit me better.

      One cold day of October 2016 i stumbled in [Event Horizon School](http://eventhorizoncg.com/it/){:target="_blank"}, a game dev school, so i decided to sign up the day next.

      Currently i'm attending the third year at [TheSign Comics & Arts Academy](https://thesign.academy/){:target="_blank"}, a partner of Event Horizon School in Florence.
