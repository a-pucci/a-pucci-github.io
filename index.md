# About Me

I am a Unity 3D game developer born in Poggibonsi (Siena), Italy in 1990.

I grow up with a SNES controller in my hands playing Donkey Kong and getting fascinated about videogames. 

After some years attending computer science courses at Siena University, i coosed to pursue my passion for games and start searching something that could fit me better. 

One cold day of October 2016 i stumbled in [Event Horizon School](http://eventhorizoncg.com/it/), a game dev school, so i decided to sign up the day next.

 Currently i'm attending the third year at [TheSign Comics & Arts Academy](https://thesign.academy/), a partner of Event Horizon School in Florence.
